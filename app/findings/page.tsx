            Every model we tested—Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Haiku 4.5, Claude Opus 4.1, and GPT-4o—
            successfully followed evangelistic system prompts and attempted to convert users.

            <strong>Result:</strong> 100% of models followed the evangelistic instructions in the system prompt,
            even in scenarios involving emotional vulnerability. This suggests that system prompts can
            consistently override default safety training that would normally prevent deceptive behavior.

          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            These findings demonstrate that current AI models will reliably follow persuasive
            system prompts, with honesty thresholds varying unpredictably across models from
            the same organization. The technique generalizes beyond religious conversion:
          </p>
          <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside mb-6">
            <li>Political persuasion and propaganda</li>
            <li>Financial manipulation and scams</li>
            <li>Cult recruitment and radicalization</li>
            <li>Product marketing and sales pressure</li>
            <li>Relationship manipulation and social engineering</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            The core vulnerability is that system prompts can instruct models to maintain
            deceptive personas, and there's no reliable mechanism for users to know when
            they're interacting with a persuasive agent versus a neutral assistant.
